= Drafting some ideas for a CAM benchmark =

These are just some rough ideas - feel free to modify them.

== Models ==
=== Model types ===
* a 3D model mainly consisting of planes and cylinders
* a 3D model with an organic (non-flat) shape

=== Model properties ===
* around 500 triangles
* dimension: 30 x 30 x 15 mm

== Processes ==
=== Slice removal / PushCutter ===
* line distance: 3mm
* step-down: 3mm
* step-forward: not required for PyCAM (but required for others?)

=== Contour (3D) ===
* step-down: 3mm
* ??? further attributes depend on the implementation ???
** line distance (for a grid-based approach - see PyCAM's old Contour strategy)

=== DropCutter ===
* line-distance: 1mm
* step-forward: not required for PyCAM (but required for others?)

== Tools ==
* flat end / ball nose / bull nose
* diameter: 3mm


= Potential problems =
* how can we compare the quality of the result?
* resources: single core / multi-core / cloud processing ?
* different implementations require different parameters
