The following examples show some command use-cases for the non-interactive generation of GCode with PyCAM:
*  load a specific settings file for the GUI:
 <pre>pycamGUI --config SOME_CONFIG_FILE</pre>
* open a model:
 <pre>pycamGUI SOME_MODEL_FILE</pre>
* generate a GCode file using all default tasks (taken from the default settings):
 <pre>pycamGUI SOME_MODEL_FILE DESTINATION_GCODE_FILE</pre>
* generate a GCode file using a custom settings file and picking just one specific task:
 <pre>pycamGUI --config YOUR_SETTINGS_FILE --task 2 SOME_MODEL_FILE DESTINATION_GCODE_FILE</pre>
