How to contribute to this wiki
==============================

Do you want to contribute something? Fix a mistake? Add some ideas?

*You are very welcome!*

The problem
-----------

Sadly sourceforge's developers did not implement a way to change the
default user permissions for the hosted application *mediawiki*. To make
matters even worse, the default permissions prevent even authenticated
sourceforge users from editing pages. Only individually selected users
have write permissions.

The solution (short term)
-------------------------

Just do this:

-   [create a PyCAM support
    request](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=237831&atid=1104177),
-   mention something about *wiki* and *write access*
-   and put in your sourceforge user account name.

It will surely take at least a day until one of us manages to respond.
We are very sorry for the delay, but we don't know how to improve this
situation until sourceforge manages to implement an administration tool
for mediawiki.

*Hint for admins:* visit <Special:UserRights> (while being logged in)
and add the new contributor to the *editor* group.

The solution (long term)
------------------------

Please visit the [feature
request](https://sourceforge.net/apps/ideatorrent/sourceforge/ideatorrent/idea/172/)
addressing the issue and vote for one of the proposals. Maybe this will
help to increase the priority of this problem.
