PyCAM can help you to prepare the model for the final processing.

== Rotate, Mirror, Swap ==
; rotate : rotate the model clockwise around a given axis
; flip : mirror the model against a given plane (xy, xz or yz)
; swap : exchange two axis of the coordinate system (e.g. exchange all x values with the corresponding y values)

== Scale ==
; scale : resize the complete model proportionally with a given factor via an input control (as a percent value). An input of 200% doubles the size of the model. The location center of the model will be preserved.
; fit dimension : scale one axis to a given value (e.g. if the unit size of your modelling software is not metric). By default all axes are scaled proportionally. This can be changed via the corresponding checkbox.

== Move ==
; move to origin : afterwards the model should start at the center of the coordinate system pointing along the posive values of the three axes.
; shift : move the model along the three axes by the distances given in the three separate input controls. Negative or zero values are allowed.

== Miscellaneous ==
Buttons referring to 2D operations are not visible if a 3D model is currently loaded (and vice versa).
; Toggle direction: reverse the direction of all lines of a 2D model
; Revise directions: (1) Try to merge open polygons regardless of their directions.<br/>(2) Analyze the inside/outside relationships of all closed polygons in a 2D model. The direction of polygons with an unsuitable winding state is reversed. This usually fixes inconsistent winding combinations created by DXF/SVG export programs.
; Extrude: add a third dimension to a 2D model. The following parameters of the slope of the edges are configurable: shape, precision, height and width. ([http://fab.senselab.org/node/227 Read more])
; 2D Projection: cut a 3D model at z=0. The resulting contour polygons define the new 2D model. The contour of the bottom of the model is used if the model is completely above or below z=0.
; Inch -> mm: scale the model by the factor 25.4
; mm -> Inch: scale the model size down with the divider 25.4
