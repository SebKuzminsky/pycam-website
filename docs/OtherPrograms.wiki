= Alternative programs for generating G-Code =
The following list contains only Free Software (GPL/BSD/...):
* [http://code.google.com/p/dxf2gcode/ dxf2gcode]: useful for engravings
* [https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/free-cad/ FreeCAD]: 3D CAD design program; G-Code generation partly integrated (2011)
* [http://code.google.com/p/heekscnc/ HeeksCNC]: add-on for [http://code.google.com/p/heekscad/ HeeksCAD]; requires STEP files instead of STL; activity [http://code.google.com/p/heekscad/ partly abandoned] by its main author (2011)
* [http://code.google.com/p/cam-occ/ cam-occ]: based on solid models instead of trimeshs (no recent releases, but development seems to be active (2010))
* [http://code.google.com/p/monocam/ monocam]: no official releases, yet; no recent development activities (2010)
* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/camvox/ camvox]: no official releases, yet; no recent development activities (2010)
* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/gcnccam/ gcnccam]: uses DXF as input; quite active
* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/cnccodegen/ CNC Code Generator]: java-based, recently not very active (2010)
* [http://gcam.js.cx GCAM]: DXF or GERBER input; sparse documentation
