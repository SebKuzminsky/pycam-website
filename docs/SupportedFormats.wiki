= Supported formats of PyCAM =
PyCAM can import and export data from and to different formats.

Read the following pages for hints about creating usable models:
* [[Hints for 2D modeling with Inkscape (SVG)]]
* [[Hints for 2D modeling with OpenSCAD (DXF)]]
* [[Hints for 3D modeling with OpenSCAD (STL)]]


== STL ==
[[wikipedia:STL (file format)|STL files]] describe the surface of 3D models as a mesh of triangles. The STL format definition describes an ascii and a binary storage format. Both are supported by PyCAM.

PyCAM can transform 3D models and save the result as an ascii STL file.

== DXF ==
[[wikipedia:DXF_(file_format)|DXF files]] can describe 3D or 2D models. PyCAM can import both types. The following DXF primitives are supported:
* LINE / POLYLINE / LWPOLYLINE
* ARC / CIRCLE
* TEXT / MTEXT
* 3DFACE

== SVG ==
[[wikipedia:Svg|Scalable vector files]] can describe 2D models. They are supposed to be used as contour models for engravings.

You need to install ''Inkscape'' and ''pstoedit'' if you want to import SVG files. Please take a look at the [[Requirements#Optional_external_programs|requirements]] for more details.

Additionally you should read the [[Hints for 2D modeling with Inkscape (SVG)|hints for Inkscape]] to avoid common pitfalls.
