Video tutorials are useful for presenting the various features of PyCAM to new users.

The existing video tutorials can be found at [http://vimeo.com/channels/158481 vimeo].

Providing these videos in different languages is quite simple - you just need to translate a small subtitles file. This will usually take around 15 minutes.

== How to translate ==
# download an existing subtitle file (preferably in English)
# copy the file to <tt>YOUR_LANGUAGE.srt</tt> (e.g. <tt>danish.srt</tt>)
# open the file with an editor that is capable of handling the UTF-8 character set (almost every modern editor should suffice)
# replace the English strings with your translations
# store the file - BEWARE: specify the UTF-8 encoding, please!
# send the file to the developer's mailing list: [mailto:pycam-devel@lists.sourceforge.net pycam-devel@lists.sourceforge.net]

Afterwards a PyCAM developer will transcode a new video with your subtitles and upload it to PyCAM's video channel.
